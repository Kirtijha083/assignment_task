# Our Services Project
This project showcases a services page with several interactive features, using Tailwind CSS and animation for a hover effect. This task was assigned to me as part of my internship with Pinak Idea Lab Private Limited. Below are the key features and instructions followed for this project.

# Project Features

-- **Container Element:**
All the code is wrapped inside a div with the ID "assignment" to keep the layout organized and encapsulated.

-- **Tailwind CSS:**
Tailwind CSS has been used to style the page, ensuring a modern, clean look with utility-first classes.

-- **Icons:**
Font Awesome icons are used, as per the project requirements. Icons help enhance the visual appeal and usability of the site.

-- **Hover Effect:**
When hovering over the boxes below the icons, each box rotates 360 degrees. A simple animation has been used to implement this smooth rotation effect.

-- **Animation:**
The 360-degree rotation of the circle containing the icons is powered. The rotation occurs smoothly upon hover and is managed by the animation.
